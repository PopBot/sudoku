# Efficient Generation and Solving of Sudoku

> add in the proper information/content.
> In order to make an actually deployable intelligent agent, it has to learn **CSS**, which also has its own syntax.
> 
> This agent can learn by training on parsed code from websites and tagging different styles/effects with the general code.
> For example it can learn how to make a list of products and the structure of a list with `<li></li>` HTML and CSS.

> Solving **Sudoku** has a similar approach to this problem described above. There's an actual valid/efficient way to
